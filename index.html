            <h1>Hi, I'm Aidan de Vaal</h1>
            <h3>BSc Computing Science Student</h3>
            <p>Hello! My name's Aidan, I'm a fourth-year BSc Computing Science student
                at Simon Fraser University. My computing specializations are in Data Analytics, 
                Game Development, Data Structures, and Algorithms. As for my personal specializations, I'm
                 an avid drummer, snowboarder, gamer, car-enthusiast, and squash player.
            </p>
            <h3>Pre-(Post-Secondary)</h3>
            <p>I was born and very briefly raised in Squamish, BC before moving to Coquitlam, BC where I've lived since.
                Transitioning from elementary school to middle school I decided to join the
                French Immersion program at Pitt River Middle, before moving on to Riverside Secondary
                where I graduated on the Honour Roll with Distinction, achieved my DELF B2 certification,
                and received my Double Dogwood Diploma.
            </p>
